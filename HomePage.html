        <p class="sectionpop">
            Sri Lanka is fortunate to have five of the seven live sea turtle species documented in the globe reported along the lovely coastline belt of 
            the island - arriving for breeding.The "big five" include the Leatherback scientifically known as Dermochelys coriacea, Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), 
            Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Olive Ridley (Chelonia mydas), and Hawksbill (Lepidochelys olivacea).
            Now, if we examine each of these turtles individually:
            In Sri Lankan waters, the green turtle is the most prevalent. An mature female, which may reach a maximum length of 1m and weighs about 250kg, can lay between 120 and 40 eggs.
        </p>
        
        <p class="sectionpop1">
            <em class="popone">The turtle population in Sri Lanka is a fascinating and vital part of the country's natural heritage. </em>Sri Lanka is renowned for its diverse marine ecosystems, and the 
                coastal areas provide important nesting grounds for several species of turtles. Five species of sea turtles can be found in Sri Lankan waters: the Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill, Leatherback, 
                and Loggerhead turtles. These gentle creatures play a significant role in maintaining the health of the oceans by feeding on seagrass, jellyfish, and other marine organisms. However, the turtle 
                population faces numerous challenges, including habitat degradation, pollution, and illegal harvesting of eggs and shells. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect these majestic 
                creatures, with dedicated turtle conservation projects and sanctuaries established along the coastline

        <p class="fp">
            <em class="popone">Unique Features of the turtle population: </em>The upper half of the turtle's shell is streamlined and short to make swimming easy, while the tortoise has a thicker shell for its protection on land. These differences in the 
            shells of the turtles and tortoises help them in their different habitats. While tortoises have short, cylindrical limbs, turtles have broad, flattened flippers that make swimming 
            much easier but make it quite difficult for females to move around on the beaches where they return to lay their eggs..

            Many of these turtle hatcheries are located are within the western and southern coasts of Sri Lanka. However not all 7 of these 
            turtles inhabit the area some turtles has their unique locations in the coasts of the paradise Isle.
            It's easy to recognize a turtle considering its unique features, but however each turtle type has its own unique feature
            Each turtle in each category can be identified by their unique turtle shell or by the patterns on their heads.

            What's unique that of turtles is that they sleep underwater. Most sea turtles live their whole lives at sea, only coming ashore to lay eggs occasionally.
            The locations are famous for its own unique turtle, and the unique turtle hatcheries.Turtles have a distinctive beak-like mouth that is adapted for their specific feeding habits. The shape of their 
            jaws and the presence of sharp, curved cusps allow them to consume a variety of food sources, including seagrasses, algae, jellyfish, and crustaceans

            <em class="popone">Sadly, because of excessive human meddling and natural predators,  </em>
            Sea turtle populations worldwide are rapidly declining. Human poachers, who abuse the eggs to

            Its vital that sea turtles must be protected from actions like illegal harvesting, habitat destruction, and pollution. Many researchers are examining these dangers and figuring

                        Thereby the it has beome a severe challenge to save these eggs
                    </li>
                    <li>Furthermore, people steal the eggs without knowledge on how to hatch them so

                for either their meat or their hardshell (Turtle shells are extremely expensive , however they're illegal to 
                keep in homes)</li>

            <ul>
                <li>For the majority of sea turtles, fishing gear poses the biggest threat. Every year, tens of thousands of turtles are unintentionally caught in gillnets, shrimp trawl 
                    nets, and on longline hooks.</li>

                    <li>
                        This could result in a very painful death to these innocent turtles, Many programs are being

            <ul>
                <li>The life cycle of sea turtles is impacted by coastal development in numerous ways. On beaches where sea turtles are nesting, development is encroaching.</li>
                <li>Additionally, waste and garbage from construction activities can damage the water along the coast, where sea turtles mate.

         In conclusion, the turtles in Sri Lanka face a multitude of threats that endanger their survival and the delicate balance of the marine ecosystems they inhabit. Habitat degradation, pollution, illegal harvesting, and fishing activities all contribute to the decline of turtle populations in the country. Urgent action is required to address these threats and implement effective conservation measures
